### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  I am a passionate JavaScript developer who has experience with React, Node.js and React Native. I have been developing lots of projects for more than two years. After     a long period of work and project development on the frontend for both web and mobile technologies, I decided to concentrate my work on the backend. To the best of my knowledge, I have experience (quite or partially) in all areas where javascript is used.

### My developer journey :earth_asia:

I started my coding adventure by learning Java langulage as my first step. By learning all root topics of a programming language in Java, I experienced and reinforced the basic concepts of coding. Then I stepped into the Javascript world and learned Vue.js and developed several web projects. I qualified to attend a React Native Bootcamp to be held in the city I live in and after successfully completing it, I decided to continue with React and developed several mobile and web projects using React Native and React. Then I started to work on the backend based on the fact that an application does not only consist of frontend, it is necessary to have experience or knowledge of all technologies used in an application. Now I continue to improve my skills developing fullstack projects.
