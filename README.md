### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate JavaScript developer who has experience with React, Node.js and React Native. I have been developing lots of projects for more than two years. After a long period of work and project development on the frontend for both web and mobile technologies, I decided to concentrate my work on the backend. To the best of my knowledge, I have experience (quite or partially) in all areas where javascript is used.
